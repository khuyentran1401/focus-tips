# Tips to Focus
As a full-time student, a data science intern, NLP research assistant, and a writter with the participation in multiple projects, I find it challenging to fully commit to something. Thus, I wrote down some tips extracted from the book [Free to Focus](https://www.amazon.com/Free-Focus-Productivity-System-Achieve-ebook/dp/B07F3DM7C1). I also shared some other tips in my [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-learn-data-science-when-life-does-not-give-you-a-break-a26a6ea328fd?source=friends_link&sk=d68e1f0b9416b7e7d3a9a8ccf047b85a). Feel free to add more productivity tips that work for you
## Fact
* We have all the time we need to accomplish what matters most
* Don't take our circumstances as excuses to do important tasks. Because circumstances will not change if we don't make efforts to change
## Task Filter
* Say no more often than yes to prioritize what is important

### How to say no
* Start with yes
* Proceed with declining with reasons and no ambiguity

## Automate

  * Check the email box and social media in the morning to keep up with things but focus during the day
* Have a ritual at night before shutting things off
  * Check email box and social media
* Document the process and compare different workflow
* Create a template
  * Whenever doing something more than onces or twice, ask yourself which part of the proccess you can reuse again. Then take the time to create a perfect template for later
  * Use the template and twist it to fit with circumstances
* Refine the proccess
* Test the workflow
* Share with others your template and ask them for their advice. They might find it helpful or find the gap in your workflow
* Automate the technology
  * Always be open to try new app
  * Learn shortcuts on your keyboard instead of using the mouse
    * Tools: Text-Expansion Software. Efficient for sending personal notes

## Review

* Focus on 3 tasks

## Actions
* Focus by turning off notification
* Reserve time for focusing
* Eliminate as many tasks as you can
* Automate your tasks so you don't need to think about them while doing one task
* Offload by delegating
